For exmaple, smoothing may be more appropriate for group-level analysis, and less appropriate for fine-grained pattern analyses. Smoothing can be accomplished with a number of functions. Volumetric smoothing can be performed with e.g. `nilearn` ([nilearn.image.smooth_img](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.image.smooth_img.html#nilearn.image.smooth_img)) or AFNI ([3dBlurInMask](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dBlurInMask.html) or [3dBlurToFWHM](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dBlurToFWHM.html)).\n",

    "\n",
    "To remove low frequency drifts in the fMRI signal, we often high-pass filter the time series during data analysis. This can be performed in a number of ways, but thankfully `nilearn` makes this very easy for us. The appropriate frequency cutoff may depend on your particular experiment, but standard default values are 1/100 (0.01) Hz, 1/128 Hz (0.0078), and 1/200 (0.005) Hz. We'll also standardize the time series to percent signal change ([Chen et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.09.066)). Ideally, we will include temporal filtering in the same regression model as our other confounds ([Lindquist et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24528)), but here we do it separately for didactic purposes. Use `nilearn`'s `clean` function to high-pass filter the data at 1/128 Hz; you can detrend the data and convert to percent-signal-change in the same function (note that you may need to transpose your masked brain data)."

In other words, if a participant moves their head too much, our motion regressors may not be able to compensate for signal deviations. In such instances, it may be preferable to use \"motion scrubbers\". These are nuisance regressors that are columns of zeros *except* for the infected volume, where a 1 is inserted instead. These act to effectively remove entirely the influence of that volume from the regression.\n",

Thankfully some guidelines have been put forward (e.g. [Power et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048)). A rough threshold is to reject any volume with a framewise displacement value above 0.5 mm. This may need to be adjusted depending on the level of motion of the participant (of course, if a participant is moving a lot it is better just to throw away their data!). If 10%-20% of a participant's data is going to be rejected even with a liberal threshold (e.g. FD = 1.0 mm), it may be better to exclude that participant entirely.\n",

For some types of data, e.g. resting-state or some naturalistic paradigms, there's no obvious experimental event structure and we really just want to clean up the data—like in this example. However, for traditional experiments with blocks or events, we would want to combine these confound regressors with our *regressors of interest* and fit a single model with both.
