    "Filtering data can help remove high-frequency artifacts (e.g. EMG artifact) and low-frequency drifts, and notch filters at 50 Hz or 60 Hz help attenuate electrical line noise. Applying a high-pass filter at 0.1 Hz or 0.5 Hz to the continuous data is useful and recommended to minimize slow drifts. More conservative high-pass filters have the potential to [distort and bias EEG analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4506207/). Use the `Raw` data's `.filter()` method to bandpass filter the EEG data between 0.5 and 40 Hz using the FIR method with zero phase. We'll use `pick_types` to specify only the EEG channels (e.g. excluding ocular channels, stimulus channels, etc). Name the output `data_filtered`."

    "### Independent component analysis (ICA)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sources of artifact in EEG data, including head motion, muscle tension, recording drift, and channel pops. Perhaps the most common source of artifact is eyeblink. Oculomotor activity causes large deflections in the EEG recording (with decreasing magnitude in channels further from the eyes). There are a number of methods for removing eyeblinks, including amplitude rejection, signal space projection (SSP), and independent component analysis (ICA). ICA finds directions in the feature space corresponding to projections with high non-Gaussianity. We thus obtain a decomposition into independent components, and the artifact's contribution is typically localized in only a small number of components. These components must be correctly identified and removed. More complete information about the theory behind ICA and its application with MNE can be found [here](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/preprocessing/plot_40_artifact_correction_ica.html). Initialize `ICA` from `mne.preprocessing` with `n_components` (the number PCs retained prior to ICA) set to 25, using `method='fastica'`. Use `pick_types` to specify the EEG channels, then use the ICA object's `.fit()` (with `decim=3`) to estimate the ICs from the EEG data."
