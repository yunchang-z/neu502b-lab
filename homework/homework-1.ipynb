Assumption #2 justifies using convolution in generating the predicted BOLD signal from a set of stimulus events, $x$, and a hemodynamic response function, $h$. Conceptually, what convolution does is add the entire HRF shape starting wherever there is a non-zero entry.\n",

The TR in this study was 2.5 seconds. In a given run, a block of images from each of the 8 categories was presented one time. Each block was ~9 TRs long and contained multiple rapid presentations of images from a single category. A subject received 12 scanning runs. In the public dataset, these runs are concatenated into a single time series 1452 TRs in duration (although we will split it back into individual runs for certain processing steps).
