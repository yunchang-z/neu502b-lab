Sounds like a lot! But scikit-learn makes it pretty straightforward. First, initialize the `LinearSVC` estimator. Since this well-behaved dataset has the same number of samples for each stimulus category in each run, we can perform leave-one-run-out cross-validation using just `KFold` rather than having to specify the runs directly. Initalize an outer `KFold` cross-validator with 12 splits and an inner `KFold` cross-validator with 11 splits. We'll search over a handful of $C$ parameters: `param_grid = {'C': [1e-2, 1e-1, 1]}`. Initialize the `GridSearchCV` estimator with the SVM estimator, the parameter grid, and the inner cross-validator; then, submit this estimator to `cross_val_predict` with the outer cross-validator to run the full analysis.

Each line of this file corresponds to a TR in the fMRI data. Next, we extracted word embeddings from GloVe for each word in each TR. For TRs containing multiple words, we averaged the embeddings. Finally, we horizontally stacked the embeddings at lags of 2, 3, 4, and 5 TRs (3, 4.5, 6, and 7.5 seconds relative to word onset) to account variable hemodynamic lags (this is effectively a finite impulse response model). Inspect and interpret the shape of the word embeddings, and visualize this matrix."
