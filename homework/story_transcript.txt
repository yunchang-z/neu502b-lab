So,I
was,a,junior
in,college
when,I,got,my,first
paying
in,my
field,on,the
radio,This,is
not,an,internship
I'm,getting,a,check

It,was,a,country,and,western,radio
station
and,my
job,though,it,was,only
on,the,weekends
was,to,play
the,top,country
hits,of
the,week,each
Sunday,It
actually,came,on,an,album
pre,recorded
so,I
had,to,take,it,out,of,the,sleeve

and,put,it,on
the,turntable,just,so
and,put,the,needle
down,on,side
one,caring
not,to,scratch
it
and,then,let,part,one,play
My,moment
is,coming,now
Yes,all,the,training
it's,coming,now,When
side,one,would,end
I,had,to,lift
the,needle

and,here's,my,moment
I
get,to,read,the,weather,live
for,Jefferson,City,Missouri




Then,I,played,commercials,and
while,the,commercials,were
playing,I,had,to,flip
the,album
put,it,back
down,on,the,turntable
put,the,needle,back,down
now,on,side,two
and
let,part,two,of,the,top
country,hits,of,the,week
play,You
know,when,you're,getting,a,degree
in,communications
or,broadcasting
they,teach,you
all,kinds,of,stuff
but,they,do,not
teach,you
how,to,flip,an,album

in,record,time
before,the,commercial
break,ends
My,career
would,eventually,bring,me,here
to,St
Louis
It's,the
largest,market
I,had,ever,been,in
I,was,excited
and
I,was,nervous
and,so
I,am
trying,to,get,to,know,the,community
And,so,I'm
going,to,every,fundraiser
and,every,event
I,can,think,of
and,after,one,of,those,events
I,promise,you,it,was
actually,here,at
the,Sheldon,in,St
Louis,Missouri
a,young,man,approached,me
outside,on,the,sidewalk
He,was,black
and,he
said,to,me
I,knew,you
were,black






Now,keep,in,mind
that
I,had,heard
pretty,much,my,whole,adult,life
You,sound,white
I'd,heard,that
I'd,heard
Oh,you,sound,white
You,sound,like
a,white,girl,I'd,heard,that
but,I,had,never
ever,heard
I,knew
you,were,black

So,he
tells,me,about
this,debate,apparently
that,had,been,going,on,in,St
Louis
when
I,first,started,here
People
told,him,Oh,no
no,she's,white,man,she's,white
she,sounds,white,she's,white
and,he
convinced
having,never,met,me
that,I,was,black
Well,as
it,turns,out,he,was
right

I,I,am
black
But,this,whole,debate
sort,of,messed
with,my,head,a,little,bit
I,thought,here
I,am,major,market
fantastic
job,of,my,dreams
and,people
still,don't,know,who,I
am,all,of
who,I,am
So,I,hatch
the,secret
plan
This,mission
I,didn't,tell,anybody,about
it,I,am,going
to,start,dropping,hints,on,the
air

so,people
so,people,will,know
who,I,am
And,so,my,first
hint,is,me
discussing,an,article
I'd,read,in,Essence
magazine

Anybody,Essence
Yes,you,get,it
Essence,Magazine,of,course
targets,African,American
women,and,so,I,think,surely
now,they,know,They,know
They,got,to,know,now
Debate,put,to,a,rest

So,I,am,now
all,about,town
and,people,are,beginning,to,recognize
me,just,from,my,voice
I'm
at,the,grocery,store
I'm,chasing,my,kids
at,the,St,Louis,zoo,yelling
at,them,people,are,recognizing
my,voice

I'm,gonna,drop,another,hint
on,the,air,I'm
enjoying,the,secret,mission
And,so
I,described
trying,to
make,my,mother's,collard
greens


Boom

They,got,to,know
They,got,to
know,now
that,I'm,a,black,woman
One
day,at,one,of,these,many,events
an,education,panel
discussion,after,it's,over
I'm,in,a,small,group
of,people,and,we,are,talking
and
an,older,white,gentleman,walks
up,to,me
and,he,says
You,speak,well
for,your,people


I,could,feel
what,you,just,said
I,could
feel,it,in,my,stomach
rising
to,my,heart
to,my,throat
and,I,said,to,him
well
well,what,people,are,you,referring,to
Now
mhm,I,knew,what,he
meant
We,all,know,what
he,meant
but,I,wanted,him
to,say,it,out,of,his,own,mouth
I,wanted,him,to,say,it
and,he,said,it

You,know,black,people

So,now,it's
really,gurgling,It,is
threatening,to,come,spewing
out,of,my,mouth
I,am,embarrassed
because,people
are,standing,around
and,they're,hearing
this,and,I'm
angry,How
dare,he,diminish,me

And,I'm,indignant
even
and,before,I,could,say,another
word,he
says,to,me
Have,you,had,any,training

She
said


Well,I,said
Nope


My,father,speaks,this
way,my,mother
speaks,this,way,and,they're
from,Mississippi
My,siblings,all
speak,this,way
God,given,talent
no,training,no
classes
none,of,that,just
little,old,me





But,I'm,still,feeling
the,secret,mission
so,I
decide,to,engage
in,a,drop,the,mic,moment
It's,closer
to,Thanksgiving,now,when,I
drop,this,hint
and,I,describe,again
um,one,of,my,mother's,recipes
for
cornbread,dressing
and,I,took,care
on,the,air,to,say,not
bread,not,white,bread
dressing,but
cornbread,dressing,where
you,make,the,cornbread
the,night,before
and,then,you,soak,it,Cornbread
dressing,and,I,thought
boom,mic,moment,they,got
to,know,I'm,through,I,can,go,home
now
They,know,I'm,black,They,know,I'm,black
now
And,so
on,the,air
one,day

I,was,just,remembering
this,conversation
I'd,had,with,these,two
women,These
two,petite
older,black,women
Gray,hair
quaffed

One,had,a,single,strand
of,pearls
They,both,had,a,touch
of,makeup
and,one,of,them,took
me,by,each,hand,and
she,pulled,me,close
and,the,other,leaned,in,so,she
could,hear
and,she,said,to,me
We
are,so
proud
of,you

And,I,got,a
lump,in,my,throat
And,I,knew,what,they,meant
They're,looking,at
me,this,young
talented
black
woman,making
her,mark,on
this,big,radio,station
in,St,Louis
But,I'm
looking,at,them

They,have,seen,and,experienced
more,than,I,will,ever
see,or,experience,or,have
to,see,or
experience
I'm,looking,at,history
in,its,face
and,I
can,feel,it
One,day
we're,in,this,debate
on,the,air
We,were,talking
about,a,it,was,a,controversy

An,organization,one,of,many

decided,to,walk,out,onto
the,highway
not,a,road
but,the,interstate
and
stop,the,traffic,and
shut,it,down
They,were,protesting
the,lack,of
minority,jobs,in,construction
And
so,one,of,the,organizations
that,was,involved
was,one,I,knew
of,from,the,time
I,lived,in,Kansas,City,Missouri,but
my,co,host,at,the,time
had,never,heard,of,them
and,so,he,was,truly
dismissive
and,I,was,truly
frustrated

And,I'm,thinking
this,is,a,movement
moment
this,is,a,moment,where
you,either,educate

or,chastise
or,enlighten,I
think,I'm,gonna,do
all,three

But,I,am,also
thinking
and,I,am,also
worried
I'm,still,kind,of,new,here

I'm,still,young
I'm,I'm,a
woman,I'm,black
and,I'm,pregnant

and,I'm,worried
about,the,stereotype
of,the,angry,black,woman
and,and,yet,I'm,also,worried
that,I,don't,speak
up,enough,about,black,issues
I'm,thinking,all,of
this
And,I,dive
right,in
and,I,said
to,him
You,know,they're,in,the,yellow,pages

You,can,look,them,up,right,now
and,call,them,they've
been,around,for,50,years

And
so,we,took,some,calls,and
we,ended,that,conversation

turned,the,mics,off
and,left,the,studio

Now,just,a
few,weeks,ago
a,gentleman
came,to,our,house,for,a,service
call,to,repair,the,windshield
of,my
car
It's,right,in,there,in,the,driveway
I,met,him,outside
and,he,said
to,me,You,know,I,have,a,friend,who
lives,over,here
and,he,told,me
that,that,news,lady
lives,over,here

Do,you,know
her

And
I,said
pausing
feeling,pride
and,trepidation

and,I,said
Well,I
I,am,that
woman
You,are
I'm,I'm,Carol,Daniel
And
and,there,it,is,again

He's,looking,at,me
He's,sizing
me,up
He,sized,me
up,in
my,driveway

and,I,thought
Did
he,think,I,was,white
Is
he,surprised,now,to,find,out,that,I'm,black


And,I,thought
the,debate
apparently,the,debate
is
still,there,in
some,form,or,fashion
I,am,not
at,all,sure,I
can,ever,really,do,anything
about,it
There's,a
lot,more,at,stake
There's,a,lot,more
to,juggle,in
my,life
There's,a,lot,more
weight,in,my,life
I,just,try
to,not,let,it,weigh,me
down

But,this,I,know

I,deserve,to
be,here
I,deserve
this,job


And,I,don't,have,this
job,because
I,sound,white
I,have
this,job
because,I,am,good
at,what,I,do
Thank
